#   This configuration file is used by dbms_scheduler when executing external
#   (operating system) jobs. It contains the user and group to run external
#   jobs as. It must only be writable by the owner and must be owned by root.
#   If extjob is not setuid then the only allowable run_user
#   is the user Oracle runs as and the only allowable run_group is the group
#   Oracle runs as.
#
# NOTES
#   For Porters: The user and group specified here should be a lowly privileged
#                user and group for your platform. For Linux this is nobody
#                and nobody.
